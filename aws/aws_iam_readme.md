## Policy Types:

*Identity-based policies*
* Managed and inline policies that can be attached to IAM entities
  (users, groups, roles)

*Resource-based policies*
* Inline policies attached to resources, like S3, KMS, etc.
* Requires a Principal. Principal can be in the same or different account.

*Permission boundaries*
* A managed policy used as a permissions boundary for an IAM entity (user or role).
* This policy defines the maximum permissions that the identity-based policies can
  grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions.
* Resource-based policies that specify the user or role as the principal
  are not limited by the permissions boundary.
* An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow.

*Organizations SCPs*
* AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) define the maximum permissions
  for the account members of an organization or organizational unit.
* SCPs limit permissions  that identity-based policies or resource-based
  policies grant to entities within the account, but do not grant permissions.

*Access control lists*
* ACLS control which principals in other accounts can access the resource to
  which the ACL is attched.
* ACLs are similar to resource-based policies.
* ACLS are cross-account permission policies that grant permissions to specified
  principal.
* ACLs cannot grant permissions to entities within the same account.

*Session policies*
* Pass advanced session policies when you use the AWS CLI or API to assume a
  role or a federated user.
* Session policies limit the permissions that the role or user's identity-basedd
  policies grant to the session.
* Session policies limit permissions for a created session, but do  not grant
  permissions.


### How to generate IAM credentials report.
```
#!/bin/bash
aws iam generate-credential-report  --profile core-services-prod
aws iam get-credential-report \
    --query Content --output text \
    --profile dev | base64 -D

```

### Creating a role with Path.
*NOTE*: AWS Console does not have a way to create a Role with Path. Only
        CLI and AWS SDK allow.

Create a role testrole,  in path /operations/

```
$ aws iam create-role \
  --role-name testrole --path /operations/ \
  --assume-role-policy-document file:///tmp/assume_role_policy_doc.json \
  --profile acguru
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/operations/",
        "RoleName": "testrole2",
        "RoleId": "AROA4GNPSIULAJQ3TRSOZ",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::838423692566:role/operations/testrole2",
        "CreateDate": "2021-04-01T00:41:39+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

Role created with ARN: ```arn:aws:iam::838423692566:role/operations/testrole```


## Policy Examples.

*Allow a user to change his own user password*

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
         "iam:ChangePassword"
     ],
     "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
     ]
}
```

*Allow a specific user IAM permissions*

```
{
      "Sid": "Stmt1464991474200",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:*",
        "config:*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "aws:userid": "*john_doe"
        }
      },
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
}
```

*Allow creating roles with specific path prefix*

When this policy is attached to an IAM entity it allows it to create roles
and instance profiles with --path /operations/. The IAM entity cannot create a
role in / 'default' path or any other --path prefix.

```
{
    "Sid": "Stmt1617235151794",
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:CreateInstanceProfile"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/operations/*",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:instance-profile/operations/*"
    ]
}
```
