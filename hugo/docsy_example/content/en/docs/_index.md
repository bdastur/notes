Solution Builder allows users to create, deploy and maintain their AWS cloud
infrastrcute. It uses [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/) to create 
cloudformation templates to manage Infrastructure as Code.
It allows you to declare solutions spanning across multiple regions and accounts
using simple JSON templates. And can manage multiple stacks as part of the scenario.

Some examples for sceanrios like cross-account IAM role access creation across 
multiple accounts, S3 cross account/cross region replication, etc. 

The solution builder is easily extensible to allow users to build new scenarios.
