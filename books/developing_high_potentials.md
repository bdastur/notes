# Notes from the course developing high potential


* Businesses don't compete. Leaders do. Companies don't die. Leaders let them die.
* Competition today is not for finance, not for money - Competition today is for talent.
* If you have the right talent in the right place, and they are allowed to
  grow, and they are given the freedom to exercise their judgement and talent,
  you have a better chance of success. Your talent pool properly deployed
  against competition is the winner.
* In most companies 2% of the talent has 98% of the impact. These people are
  not necessarily at the top. Find those people, nurture those people. Put them
  in the right places. Give them autonomy to experiment, iinnovate and test
  where they can go.
* High potential leaders are different from high potential individuals. The HP
  leaders are a magment for other talent. They stretch other talent. They get
  people to work with them voluntarily to do what is needed. They expand other's
  potential
* Feedback is not given once a year, feedback is given as you progress.
* Leadership is a practicing art.

* HP Leaders imagine big. Big needs. WWhat the customer will have, will not have
  and those are real, not hallucinations.
* They have a particular skill: When they imagine that the need is real or the
  problem is real, it has not been solved, they have the ability to precisely
  define what are the roadblocks. They are very clear, they go through a lot of
  mental gymnastics to isolate and they know they can't solve it, but pinpointing
  impossible hurdles is what they thrive on. They find those who can.
* They have the courage and gumption to pick up the phone and call anybody.


* You are in charge and you are the master of your own destiny. You can seek help,
  but you are in charge. You cannot ask someone else to be in charge.

* Avoid getting siloed, following the traditional organization, doing the same
  things over and over. Your focus will get narrower and narrower and over time
  you will not be able to see the big picture. Avoid that.

* Whatever you do, master these skills. Demonstrate you can perform and build
  crredibility. Always ask are you expanding your potential? So look for leaps,
  more scope, more complexity, more uncertainty. And if you don't get a chance
  in the same place, find some other place because you are in charge of your
  personal growth.

* You didn't fail and experiment failed. Failure is the basis of innovation
  in your own capacity.

* Focus on skills, resiliency in your personality, ability to build networks.
* Every single job you take, ask a question. Am I growing? What's my next leap?

* Swallow your ego. Don't wear your high potential on your sleeves. Let people
  see you because if you are, you will be the magnet.


Five skills:

* Be very objective about yourself. How much of a potential you have and how
  you are going to extend it.

ROYT (Return on your time).
* Time is constant for everybody. So focus on the things that give you the highest
  return on your time.
* Steve Jobs had a rule of three. Focus on 3 most important things. Learn about
  it, master it and get it done. Your capacity will increase over time.

* Keep looking for big ideas, build credibility for getting things done. Big
  ideas don't get solved in one bite. You may have to figure out a different way
  to design those ideas for execution. You have got to get big talent, teams,
  people together. Mobilize them to increase their capacity.

* Ability to look at something from 50,000 feet and go to 50 feet. When you
  are at 50 feet, ability to see 50,000 feet.

* What do you do if you are stuck in a wrong place/job. How do you decide to
  stay or move on?
Follow this Criteria:
- Be very honest with yourself. Ask have I stopped growing? Did I pickup a new
  skill in the past 4 months. Am I being positioned to pick new skills? Know that
  you are in charge. If this is the case, Time has come to move on.

- You have a boss, doesn't give you feedback, does not seem to care, and your
  relationship is not good. Time has come to move on.

- The top has begun to decline. In a declining company that does not show
  turnaround, it's not a great place for you to be in. Move on.

- Now there would be a case where things aren't so black and white. Things
  aren't good or things are not improving, but you are learning. But you are
  wrestling with your own difficulties with your environment, with your team,
  your boss. Feedback is the juice for personal growth. Feedback in a context,
  feedback that is constructive. Feedback is not 5000 sentences.

- Most high potentials go off the rail for one reason. Their ego, and they don't
  listen.

* Find what makes you happy. Not just materialistic things.
* Reform the system and not be run by it.
* Reflection is for refocus. Reflection to search what gives you happiness.
* High potentials have the narcissistic abilities to destroy themselves. Avoid it.
