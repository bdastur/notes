# How to measure Anything - Finding the Value of 'INTANGIBLES' in Business

**Author: Douglas W. Hubbard**

## Preface
* Information on different approaches to probabilities "Bayesian" vs "frequentist" 
  interpretations of probability.

* Correct the costly myth that some things can't be measured. This belief is a 
  significant drain on the economy, environment, public welfare and national
  security.

* Important decisions require better knowledge of the alleged intangible.
  The belief that some things - even very iimportant thhings - might be 
  impossible tto measure is a sand in the gears of the entire economy and
  the welfare of the population.


## Part 1
**The Measurement Solution Exists**

## Chapter 1: The challenge of intangibles

**Points**:

* Anything can be measured. If something can be observed in any way at all,
  it lends itself to some type of measurement method. No matter how "fuzzy"
  the measuremenet is, it's still a measurement if it tells you more than you
  knew before.

* Start with asking the right questions. 

* Alleged Intangibles:
  - Word literally means some thing that cannot be touched. Yet there are many
    such intangibles that are considered measurable. - Like time, budget, etc.
  - Few examples:
    - The flexibility to create new products
    - The value of information
    - The risk of bankruptcy
    - Management eeffectiveness

* Each of these examples could be very relevant to a major decision an
  organization must make. It could be the single most important determinant
  of success or failure. Yet due to percieved immeasurability the decision
  can be misinformed.

* Another irrational way an immeasurable would be treated as a key strategic
  principle or "core value" of the organization. In this case an intagible
  is treated as "must have", so the question of the degree to which the
  intangible matters is never considered in a rational, quantitative way.

* In fact, all the previously listed intangibles are measurable and have
  already been measured by someone.

**Appliend Information Economics**
1. Define the decision
2. Determine what you know now.
3. Compute the value of additional information. (If none, go to step 5)
4. Measure where information value is high. (Return to steps 2 and 3
   until furtther measurement is not needed)
5. Make a decision and act on it. (Return to step 1 and repeat as each
   action creates new decisions)

In short *Measure what matters, Make better decisions*


Summary:
An argument for measuring the intangibles. Examples of what are the so called
intangibles, and how our inability to measure these lead to expensive mistakes
and suboptimal decisions.


## Chapter 2: An intutive measurement habit: Eratosthenes, Enrico and Emily

*Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingnes
to work on something for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something
that most people would give up on after thirty seconds.*

* The concept of measurement as "uncertainty redduction" and not necessarily
  the elimination of uncertainty is a central theme o this book.


## chapter 3: The illusion of intangibles: Why Immeasurables Aren't

Why people think something can't be measured:

1. Concept of measurement: The definition of measurement itself is widely
   misunderstood. If one understands what "measurement" actually means, a
   lot more things become measurable.

2. Object of measurement: The thing being measured is not well defined.
   Sloppy and ambiguous language gets in the way of measurement.

3. Methods of measurement: Many procedures of empirical observation are not
   well known. If people were familiar with some of these basic methods, it
   would become apparent that many things thought to be iimmeasurable are not
   only measurable but may already have been measured.

Some misguided reasons of why something shouldn't be measured:

1. The economic objection to measurement - too expensive
2. Usefulness and meaningfulness of statistics
3. Ethical objection.

### The concept of measurement:

* We incorrectly think that measurement means meeting some high unachievable
  standard of certainty.

* Measuring something is percieved as "to quantify somethiing", "to compute
  an exact value", "to reduce to a single value"  and so on. 

* If exact quantity with no room for error was the definition of measurement
  then indeed very few things wouuld be measurable.

A definition of measurement: An "Information Theory" Version

**Measurement:** A quantitatiively expressed reduction of uncertainty based
on one ore more observations.


* For all practical decision-making purposes, we needd to treat measurement
  as observations that quantitatively reduce uncertainty.

* Claude Shannon developed a field called "information theory" in 1940s. He was
  an electrical engineer, mathematician and a savant who dabbled in robotics
  and computer chess programs. He published a paper - "A Mathematical
  Theory of Communication" which laid the foundation for information theory and
  in some sense measurement in general.

* Shannon proposed a mathematical definition of information as the amout of
  uncertainty reduction in a signal, which he discussed in terms of "entropy"
  removed by a signal. 

**A variety of measurement scales**

* A measurement doesn't have to eliminate uncertainty, but a mere reduction
  in uncertainty counts as a measurement and can be worth much more than the
  cost of the measurement.

* Second point about measurement is it doess not have to be about a quantity
  in any way. A measurement is "quantitively expressed." - the uncertainty
  at leasst has to be quantified, but the subject of  observation might not
  be a quantity itself - it could be entirely qualitative, like a membership
  in a set.

* Stanley Smith Stevens wrote an article called "On the theory of scales and
  measurement". He describes different scales of measurement, including
  nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.

* Nominal measurements: are simply "set membership" statements such as whether
  a fetus is male or female or whether you have a particular medical condition.

* Ordinal scales: allows us to say one value is more than another. But not by
  how much. Examples like 4 star rating systems for movies or Mohs hardness
  scale for minerals. A "4" on either scale is more than "2", but not twice
  as much.

* Ratio scales: Homogenous units such has dollars, kilometers, volts, liters
  and such tell us not just one thing is more than another, but by how much.
  These scales can be added, subtractted, multiplied and devided in a way
  that makes sense.

* Interval scales: are almost like ratio scales in that they have deefined
  units, but the "zero" is an arbitary point, like the celsius scale of temperature.
  A "zero" on this scale does not mean "no temperature".


**Bayesian Measurement: A pragmatic concept for decisions**

* We treat uncertainty as a feature of the observer, not necesssarily the thing
  being observed. When we sample the avg weight of Salmon in a river by
  sampling, we are not changing their weith, but chaning our uncertainty 
  about their weights.

* Probabilities are used to quantify our initial uncertainty and the change
  in it based on observations.

* Probability - "Degree of belief"

* If you are almost certain about something - like majority of customers will
  buy a new model of a product, you may say there is a 97% probability of it.
  If you are unsure you may say there is a 50% probability. 
  Similarly if you are very uncertain about say commute time of daily workers 
  in Bay areea you may say 90% probability the value falls within 10 min and 90 
  minutes. If you had more information you might narrow the range and still 
  assign 90% probability that the value falls within the range.

* This view of probabilities is called the "Bayesian" interpretation.

* The "frequentist" interpretation of proabability states that probability
  is not a state of the observer, but an objective feature of some system.


**The object of measurement**

*There is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the
  ambiguity of words* - Thomas Reid(1710-1769), Scottish philosopher

* Some things seem immeasurable because we simply don't know what we mean
  when we first pose the question. We haven't unambigously defined the
  object of measurement.

* Once you figure out what you mean and why it matters, the issue in question
  starts to look a lot more measurable.

* "clarification chain" is just a short series of connections that should bring
  us from thinking about something as an intangible tto thinking of it as 
  tangible.

* Clarification chain:
  - If it matters at all, it is detectable/observable.
  - If it is detectable, it can be detected as an amount (or range of 
    possible amounts).
  - If it can be detected as a range of possible amounts, it can be measured.

* It also helps to state why we want to measure something in order to 
  understand what is really being measured.
