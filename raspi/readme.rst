```

Update/Upgrade- https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md
Open a terminal and type in
“sudo apt-get update”,
this make take a few minutes and you’ll see the progress in the terminal window.

Next, in the Terminal, type in “sudo apt-get upgrade”


	Go through the Pi menu
	File manager

Scratch
   	-Open scratch, check the sensor tab, start the GPIO server recheck the sensor tab. We should have some new options.

	Let’s Build a Clock





GPIO Pins!


Blink

Can you change the timing?

Can you get two lights to turn on?

Button


How would you link a button and an LED?

Analog Output
A range of values: 0-1023(off………completely on)

let’s open and save a file called “helloWorld.py”, hit enter
We’ll enter the code below and run it through the shell




Blink
we’ll just turn an LED on to start with.
