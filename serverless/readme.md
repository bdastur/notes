# Serverless.

There is a section on serverless (Lambda) in aws/readme.md. However I think now 
serverless deserves a new folder.

* Run code/service without provisioning or managing servers.
* Pay only for the compute time that you consume.
* Supports synchronous and asynchronous invocation of lambda function.
* When the lambda function is invoked from another aws service, the invocation type
  is pre-determined.
* Languages supported: C#, Java, Node.js, Python.
* Lambda billing is based on both, the MB of RAM reserved and the execution duration
  in 100ms units.
