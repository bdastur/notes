# Obfuscation & Optimization

## Obfuscation:
Transforming code to make it harder to understand without chaning the functionality.
There are tools that can help achive that. Strategies to obfuscate include:
 * Renaming variables, functions etc to random strings
 * Removing extra spaces
 * Transforming code into compact forms.


### Tools
* [Pyminifier](http://liftoff.github.io/pyminifier/)
* Pyobfuscate
* Pyarmor (Shareware)


## Encryption
[Pyconcrete](https://github.com/Falldog/pyconcrete) encrypts python files and decrypts it when imported. It uses AES 128 bit
encryption.


## Speeding this up.
Python inherintly is slower than other compiled languages. What it provides in 
ease of use and speed of development, it lacks in runtime performance. There are steps
we can take to improve python performance.

## Generating byte code in python

```

```

## Cython.

### Installing cython:

```
sudo xcode-select --install
pip install cython
```
